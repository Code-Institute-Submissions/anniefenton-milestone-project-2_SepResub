# Trek Around 
## UX
### Project Goals

This site aims to feature the best tried-and-tested hiking routes in the UK, using interactive elements such as Google Maps API, and EmailJS. The site will feature user's reviews of hiking routes whilst raising awareness of the beautiful landscape within the UK. There will also be a feature where the site-owner can offer their service of designing bespoke and tailoured walks for users. 

### User Goals
**Novice Hiker**

A novice hiker would be new to the world of hiking. They may want to know much about the routes local to them, what difficulty the routes are, and what other people's experienecs are of them. They may be quite nervous or apprehensive to go on their first hike so they would be looking for reassurance from the site.

**Experienced Hiker**

These hikers will have done a lot of hiking in the past, and would be willing to travel further afield to find new experiences. They may want to share their experiences and reviews with others on the site, as well as gain inspiration for their next hike. They may also want to have a unique hiking experience so would be willing to pay to have a bespoke hike designed to them.

**Traveller**

Travellers may also use this site. They may be doing a road-trip around the UK and want to plan in hikes from all over, or they may be staying in one area so would want to explore their local area. They could either be novice or experienced hikers but would use the site primarily for inspiration and local knowledge.
